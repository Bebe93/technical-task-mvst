# Technical Task MVST

this exercise is part of the hiring process for the position of Full Stack Developer at MVST.

The task is to display the repositories and allow the user to filter through the repositories by name using a search bar. 
Use the [official GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch repositories per user.

### Requirements
- The application must be written using React
- You are required to use git for versioning
- Feel free to use any additional plugin/module to help you get the task done more
effectively
- Google Chrome is the testing browser

The files in this repository are the result of the task made by Beatrice Rossi

### Procedure
1. I decided to work only on the frontend because I could fetch the API directly from there, without building a beckend part.
2. I could've separated the exercise into different components but felt more comfortable building everything on App.js, since it's less than 100 lines of code.
3. I commented on the code every decision that I felt that needed to be explained.
4. I am learning how to use GraphQL so I didn't use it for this technical task, but I will definetly keep working on this exercise in the future using the v4 API.
5. I am aware of the fact that the console shows a couple of warnings, but since they're not errors I decided to prioritize being on time with the delivery.
